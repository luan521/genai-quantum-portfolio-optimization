# Test 1
- Objective: Evaluate an alternative QAOA configuration that uses a customized mixer operator and a tailored initial state, ensuring the budget constraint is met by design and reducing the effective search space.
- Conclusion: With this architecture in place, the classical benchmark optimizer (COBYLA) successfully converged to the optimal solution.

# Test 2
- Objective: Evaluate a GPT‑2 architecture for generating QAOA parameters.
- Conclusion: The GPT‑2 model delivered superior results compared with the other approaches.
